This is a concise skeleton for building single-page web apps with [PostgreSQL] (https://www.postgresql.org/), 
Python ([Flask] (http://flask.pocoo.org/)), [Angular 2] (https://angular.io/), and [Heroku] (https://www.heroku.com/).

## Database

We use **PostgreSQL** as the database engine/server for this application.
PostgreSQL is an *object-relational database* that enables us to store data 
securely and retrieve data using the relational database model. For more information
about PostgreSQL, go to this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL).

In this project, the PostgreSQL database is installed inside the virtual machine
(thanks to Vagrant). The database can be viewed through a client application 
using the crendentials below.

### PostgreSQL Database
    Host:     localhost
    Port:     5432
    Database: app_db
    Username: postgres
    Password: password

### pgAdmin
pgAdmin is a free to use, open-source management, and administration client for PostgreSQL.
pgAdmin can be used to manage and view your database, tables, and data. To download pgAdmin, 
go to this [link](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

### Connecting to PostgreSQL Database using pgAdmin

#### 1. After downloading pgAdmin, open the application and click on "Add New Server."
![Alt text] (docs/img/pgAdmin1.png "pgAdmin Step 1")

#### 2. Add a name for the server.
![Alt text] (docs/img/pgAdmin2.png "pgAdmin Step 2")

#### 3. Click on the "Connection" tab.
![Alt text] (docs/img/pgAdmin3.png "pgAdmin Step 3")

#### 4. Enter all the fields and click "Save."
![Alt text] (docs/img/pgAdmin4.png "pgAdmin Step 4")

#### 5. If the connection is successful, the database will appear on the left side of the screen.
![Alt text] (docs/img/pgAdmin5.png "pgAdmin Step 5")

## Setting up the Database
In this project, we use a script called **manage.py** to automate the process of setting up 
the database. This script is used to automatically create the tables in the database from 
the Python models. Here is how you can use it.

### Creating the tables from the Python models
After implementing all the Python models, use this command to create the tables in the database. 
Make sure you are inside the vagrant folder in the virtual machine.
>
```bash
python3 manage.py create
```
![Alt text] (docs/img/db1.png "Creating DB Tables")
*You can view the new tables created in pgAdmin.*
![Alt text] (docs/img/pgadmin_db1.png "pgAdmin Creating DB Tables")

### Dropping the tables from the database
Use this command to drop all the tables from the database. 
Make sure you are inside the vagrant folder in the virtual machine.
>
```bash
python3 manage.py drop
```
![Alt text] (docs/img/db2.png "Dropping DB Tables")
*You can check if the tables were dropped in pgAdmin.*

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. How do I run the application again after turning off my computer?
Follow steps 3 through 8 from above.

#### 2. I have made changes to a page, but browser is not displaying the changes.
Close the browser. Restart the application. Cancel the gulp command 
(press CTRL-C) and run the gulp command once again. Open the browser again 
and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If that does not fix
the issue, delete all the browser history and refresh the page again.
